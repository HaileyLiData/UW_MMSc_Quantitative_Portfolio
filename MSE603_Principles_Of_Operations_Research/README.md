## 🧠 Learning Insights  
Through MSE603, I developed a deeper understanding of optimization as both a **mathematical system** and a **decision-making philosophy**.  
I learned to interpret constraints as resource limits, and dual variables as indicators of hidden economic value.  

Key takeaways:  
- The power of mathematical reasoning in business decisions.  
- How optimization models reveal trade-offs between cost and performance.  
- Improved confidence in translating practical problems into structured models.
