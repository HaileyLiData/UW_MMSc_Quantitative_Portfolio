# Assignment 1 â€“ The Simplex Method

This folder contains my work for **Assignment 1** of MSE603 (Principles of Operations Research).  
In this assignment, I applied the **Simplex Method** to solve linear programming problems and explore optimality conditions.

ðŸ§® **Key Topics**
- Formulating Linear Programming (LP) models with objective functions and constraints  
- Performing tableau iterations to identify entering and leaving variables  
- Applying the ratio test and pivot operations to reach the optimal solution  
- Understanding degeneracy and alternative optimal solutions  
- Verifying results with Excel Solver and manual computation
