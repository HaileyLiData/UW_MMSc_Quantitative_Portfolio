# Assignment 1 â€“ The Simplex Method

This assignment focuses on solving Linear Programming (LP) problems using the **Simplex Method**.  
It covers:
- Setting up an LP model with decision variables, objective function, and constraints.  
- Performing tableau iterations to find the optimal solution.  
- Identifying entering and leaving variables through ratio tests.  
- Understanding degeneracy and alternative optima in LP.  

Tools used: Excel Solver and manual calculations.  
Learning outcome: developed strong procedural understanding of the simplex algorithm and its practical application in resource allocation problems.
