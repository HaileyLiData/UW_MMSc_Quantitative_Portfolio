# Assignment 2 â€“ Duality and Sensitivity Analysis

This assignment explores the concepts of **LP duality** and **sensitivity analysis**.  
It includes:
- Formulating the **dual problem** and interpreting dual variables (shadow prices).  
- Applying the **complementary slackness** condition to connect primal and dual solutions.  
- Conducting **sensitivity analysis** to evaluate how changes in parameters (objective coefficients or RHS values) affect the optimal solution.  
- Understanding the managerial meaning behind dual values and sensitivity ranges.  

Tools used: Excel Solver and manual LP analysis.  
Learning outcome: enhanced understanding of the economic interpretation of duality and the stability of optimal solutions under parameter changes.
