# Assignment 2 ‚Äì Duality and Sensitivity Analysis

This folder contains my work for **Assignment 2** of MSE603 (Principles of Operations Research).  
In this assignment, I explored **duality theory** and **sensitivity analysis** to interpret the economic meaning of linear programming solutions.

üîç **Key Topics**
- Formulating and interpreting **dual problems**  
- Applying **complementary slackness** between primal and dual solutions  
- Analyzing **shadow prices** and their managerial implications  
- Conducting **sensitivity tests** on objective coefficients and RHS values  
- Understanding how parameter changes affect optimality and feasibility  

**Files included:**
