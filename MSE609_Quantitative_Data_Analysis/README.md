# MSE609 â€“ Quantitative Data Analysis

This folder contains my coursework, R Markdown files, and reports for **MSE609: Quantitative Data Analysis**, part of the **Master of Management Sciences (MMSc)** program at the **University of Waterloo**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Course Overview
This course focuses on applying statistical and probabilistic methods to real-world data problems.  
It emphasizes model building, inference, and interpretation using **R programming**.

## ðŸ§© Key Topics
- Probability distributions and sampling
- Bayesian inference and conditional probability
- Estimation and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
- Linear and multiple regression modeling
- Interaction effects and model validation
- Hypothesis testing and confidence intervals

## ðŸ›  Tools & Skills
- **Software:** R, R Markdown, Excel  
- **Libraries:** `stats`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `car`  
- **Methods:** Regression, AIC/BIC comparison, residual analysis, and model diagnostics

## ðŸ“‚ Assignments Included
- `Assignment_1_Probability_Distributions.Rmd`
- `Assignment_2_Bayes_Theorem.Rmd`
- `Assignment_3_MLE_and_Model_Validation.Rmd`
- `Assignment_4_Linear_Regression_and_Interaction.Rmd`

## ðŸ§  Learning Outcome
By completing this course, I developed the ability to:
- Analyze quantitative data and interpret statistical results clearly  
- Build predictive models using R  
- Apply probabilistic reasoning and model validation techniques to managerial decisions
