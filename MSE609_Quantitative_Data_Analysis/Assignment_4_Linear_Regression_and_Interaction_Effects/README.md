# Assignment 4 ‚Äì Regression and Hypothesis Testing

This folder contains my R Markdown and PDF report for **Assignment 4** of MSE609 (Quantitative Data Analysis).  
In this assignment, I explored **simple linear regression**, **p-values**, and **p-hacking reflection**.

### üß† Key Topics
- Building a simple linear regression model with `lm()` and interpreting coefficients
- Testing \( H‚ÇÄ: Œ≤‚ÇÅ = 0 \) and evaluating p-values and confidence intervals
- Observing sample variation across different random seeds
- Analyzing R¬≤, residual plots, and standard error of the estimate
- Reflecting on the limitations of p-value significance and the problem of *p-hacking*
- Emphasizing transparent reporting over arbitrary Œ± thresholds

**Files included:**
- `MSE609_Assignment4_Xiaohui (Hailey) Li Q1&Q2.Rmd`
