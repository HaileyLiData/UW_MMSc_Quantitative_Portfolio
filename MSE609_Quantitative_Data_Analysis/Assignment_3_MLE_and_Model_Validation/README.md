# Assignment 3 â€“ MLE and Model Validation 

This folder contains my R Markdown file for **Assignment 3** of MSE609 (Quantitative Data Analysis).  
In this assignment (Questions 1â€“3), I applied **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)** and **cross-validation** to evaluate statistical models.

### ðŸ§  Key Topics
- Estimating parameters for the **Normal distribution** using `optim()` and `nlm()`
- Comparing sample sizes (n = 50 vs n = 5000) to observe estimator stability
- Performing **10-fold cross-validation** to compare Normal and Gamma models
- Computing log-likelihoods and selecting the best model based on average fit
- Analytical comparison between **Uniform vs Exponential** distributions for waiting-time data
- Discussing MLE properties: consistency, efficiency, and bias reduction with large samples

**Files included:**
- `MSE609_Assignment3_Xiaohui (Hailey) Li_Q1&2.Rmd`
