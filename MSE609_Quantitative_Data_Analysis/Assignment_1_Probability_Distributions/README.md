# Assignment 1 â€“ Probability Distributions

This folder contains my R Markdown file for **Assignment 1** of MSE609 (Quantitative Data Analysis).  
In this assignment, I explored the concepts of **probability distributions**, **sampling simulation**, and **visualization** using R.

### ðŸ§  Key Topics
- Generating random samples from distributions (`rnorm`, `rexp`, `runif`)
- Plotting probability density and cumulative distribution functions
- Understanding randomness and reproducibility with `set.seed()`

**File included:**  
`MSE609_Assignment1_Xiaohui Li (Hailey).Rmd`
