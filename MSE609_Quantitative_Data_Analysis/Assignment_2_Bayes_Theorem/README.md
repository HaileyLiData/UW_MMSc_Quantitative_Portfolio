# Assignment 2 ‚Äì Bayes Theorem and Decision Analysis

This folder contains my R Markdown and PDF files for **Assignment 2** of MSE609 (Quantitative Data Analysis).  
In this assignment, I applied **Bayes‚Äô theorem**, **posterior probability updating**, and **decision analysis** to solve problems under uncertainty.

### üîç Key Topics
- Computing posterior probabilities using **Bayes‚Äô theorem**
- Evaluating **expected monetary values (EMV)** for different decisions
- Building and interpreting **decision trees**
- Applying **conditional probabilities** to real-world scenarios
- Comparing **prior** vs. **posterior** beliefs in statistical reasoning

**Files included:**
- `MSE609_Assignment2_Xiaohui_(Hailey)_Li.pdf`
